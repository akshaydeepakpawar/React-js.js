# React Monster Class – My Learning Journey

This repo has all the assignments, practice code, and notes I’m doing while following the 50+ Hours React.js Monster Class by HuXn WebDev. I’m treating this like a full learning path, so each section has its own folder with the code I wrote while watching the course.

## What’s Inside
- React fundamentals  
- Hooks and custom hooks  
- State management  
- Routing  
- TypeScript with React  
- Next.js  
- Tailwind and UI components  
- Small projects and exercises from the course  
- My own practice builds
